# TicTacToe

A 4x4 TicTacToe game developed in Android where two players can play.

##Rules:
1. Player takes alternate chances to play.
2. Form a row/column and you win.
3. Form a diagonal on the board and you win.
4. Occupy the 4 corners and you win.
5. Forma a 2x2 box within the board and you win.


The main components of this project are:
1. TicTacToeBoard - a custom component that forms the visual representation for the board.
2. GameEngine - Class controls the whole game and decides on the outcome of the game.

Note: The game can be extended to larger boards of say 5x5, 6x6 etc.
